sentence=Advanced stepper motor library with acceleration, automatic power management, and inversion support.
paragraph=The PropulsionStepper library provides an easy-to-use interface for controlling stepper motors with advanced features. It supports continuous and absolute motion with acceleration, automatic power management for energy efficiency, direction inversion, and enable pin inversion for different driver types. Supports 2/3-pin drivers with step, direction, and optional enable pins (both active LOW and HIGH).
